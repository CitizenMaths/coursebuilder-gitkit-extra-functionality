# coursebuilder-gitkit-extra-functionality
Additional functionality added to Gitkit code to allow transfer of progress and personal data from a pre-exisiting user using a Google sign in account to a Gitkit account, as well as storing the user temporarily during the life of a single request to save making multiple lookups to the gitkit service

Important:
You will need to setup coursebuilder to use GITKIT before any of this code is useful.
You can find instructions on how to setup GITKIT in the Google's own documentation,
and this guide may also prove useful in setting coursebuilder up to use GITKIT: https://github.com/pabloppp/Course-Builder-gitkit-setup-guide
Even though the guide says it is for GCB 1.9, the majority is still valid for GCB 1.10
